- Hi, my name is Julio Pólito, I'm mexican and I recently started to work as a web developer.
- I like to learn new technologies about web development, also I'm really interested in graphic design, color theories, games and music.
- I continue learning about Angular and async programming.
- I'm working on my portfolio, I'll share it soon ;)
